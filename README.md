# A_Star_Sequencer

### An implementation of A* path planning algorithm purposed as a step sequencer used to trigger music events in maxMSP.

#### This project was made infinitely more approachable with the helpful documentation provided by [Pawel Janicki](https://www.paweljanicki.jp/projects_maxandp5js_en.html) which elaborates on how to integrate p5.js with maxMSP.  Additionally, [Daniel Shiffman's tutorial](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/051.1-astar.html)  on implementing A* in p5.js was a truly wonderful resource to be able to reference.
